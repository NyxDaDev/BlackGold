# TrueOPEC
TrueOPEC (OPEC) is an ERC20-compliant token that is the first cryptocurrency to be directly pinned to the current price of the OPEC Reference Basket.
The supply is not mineable, and is directly pinned to the OPEC Oil Reserves. Supply will be adequate adjusted every year to match the exact value provided by OPEC¹.
Here are the sources TrueOPEC uses:

¹ - Supply will be adjusted as soon as possible. We rely on the annual reports of OPEC for our information, and we will adjust adequately whenever this information is made publicly available.
